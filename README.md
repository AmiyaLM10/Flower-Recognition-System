## 🧠 Core AI Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The heart of the Flower Recognition System is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a deep learning model ideal for image classification tasks.

### 🔍 Model Architecture Highlights:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts flower images resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 180×180 pixels).  
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features like petal shapes, colors, and textures.  
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving key features.  
- **Dense Layers**: Interpret extracted features and perform classification.  
- **Output Layer**: Uses `softmax` activation to predict the probability of each flower class.

> Trained on a labeled dataset of flower images with optimization using **Adam** optimizer and **categorical crossentropy** loss.
